## Data Files
The data files required for this project are too large to store in GitHub. You will need to download them manually and place them in the following structure:

Data/Raw/ <br />
├── FER2013/ <br />
│    └── train_images.npy <br />
├── KDEF/ <br />
│    └── train_images.npy <br />
├── Mixed/ <br />
│    └── train_images.npy <br />
├── Natural_Human_Face_Images/ <br />
└── train_images.npy <br />

Data files will be hosted on cloud storage (Dropbox/Google Drive). Links will be added soon.
